# Voxel Edit

## Installation Guide

To run the program locally, first install **Node.js** from [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) link.

From there, clone the voxel-eit repo to your computer, open your terminal, and then cd into the project. For my Windows 10 computer, I would open Powershell then enter the following:

```
cd C:\Users\myUsername\Documents\Projects\voxel-edit
```

Once inside the voxel-edit directory, you need to install all of the dependencies for the project with **npm**. npm should have been automatically installed with Node.js.

To install all needed dependencies for the project, run the following command while in the root directory of the project:

```
cd ./your/project/location/voxel-edit
npm install
```

Once everything has finished installing, we can now run the application! To do this, there are several scripts made available with the courtesy of [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) which is the template that this project is based on.

To start a local server to run the program, type this command while in the root directory of the project:

```
cd ./your/project/location/voxel-edit
npm start
```

Now the project is up and running! In case your web browser doesn't automatically open, the project should be running at the following address:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

After connecting to the site, it may take a moment for everything to load for the first time. Please be patient and pay close attention to the console in case any errors do arise.

Congratulations! Everything should now be up and running!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
